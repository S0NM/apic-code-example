# What is this for

This is created to provide a *pseudo backend* to showcase how the OAuth customization work.  
To use this, 
- create a product
- publish the product to your catalog

And start using it.

Refer to the comment in the utility.yaml for the function that can be customized for the oauth testing.

Note that this is work in progress, and as time allowed, and more customization is created, I will enhance this file.  And feel free to contribute to it too.
